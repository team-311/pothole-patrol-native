# Pothole Patrol

Pothole Patrol is a comprehensive pothole management system for Chicago, built using real data from 30,000 pothole service requests submitted this year. With it, residents can report potholes, Chicago administrators can oversee pothole repair, and city crew members can access their daily repair assignments and update admins on their progress.

## Why

Pothole Patrol was created by four city of Chicago residents as their capstone project at FullStack Academy. As city residents, they were all too familiar with the condition of Chicago's asphalt-patchworked streets and were excited to develop a tool that could be used to address the issue. 

## Unique Features 

* Users have the chance to upvote potholes that already exist in the city of Chicago's database, which helps provide visibility into which ones are the most urgent. 
* Pothole Patrol's scheduling system finds the most urgent potholes and sends them for repair most quickly. It was implemented by using an algorithm that ranks potholes based on their upvotes and the number of days they’ve been open and sends them to work crews who are nearby. 

## Tech and Frameworks
